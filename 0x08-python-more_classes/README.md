# Python Classes and Objects

This folder contains a collection of Python scripts and examples related to object-oriented programming (OOP) using classes and objects in Python.

## Introduction

Python's support for classes and objects is a fundamental feature of the language that enables you to create reusable, structured code. This folder provides examples and explanations related to Python classes and objects, including inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and more.

## Folder Contents
- `0-rectangle.py:` an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle
- `1-rectangle.py:` class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: `(based on 0-rectangle.py)` with additional functionalities
- `2-rectangle.py:` a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: `(based on 1-rectangle.py)` with additional `area` and `perimeter` methods for the rectangle
- `3-rectangle.py:` a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: `(based on 2-rectangle.py)` with `print()` and `str()` methods that print the rectangle
- `4-rectangle.py`  a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: `(based on 3-rectangle.py)` with additional `eval()` method
- `5-rectangle.py`  a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: `(based on 4-rectangle.py)` with additional `del()` method
- `6-rectangel.py`  a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: `(based on 5-rectangle.py)` with additional `number_of_instances` class variable that counts that instances of the class
- `7-rectangle.py`  a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: `(based on 6-rectangle.py)` with additional `print_symbol` class variable that is used for string representation
- `8-rectangle.py`  a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: `(based on 7-rectangle.py)` with additional `bigger_or_equal(rect_1, rect_2)` static method that returns the biggest rectangle based on the area
- `9-rectangle.py`  a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: `(based on 8-rectanglee.py)` with additional `square(cls, size=0)` method that returns a new Rectangle instance with width == height == size
